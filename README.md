## Cover Letter/About

As a (rising) Computer Science junior at the Institute of Business Administration, Karachi, my academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in computer science principles and practical experience in various programming languages and technologies.

My interests lie at the intersection of technology and business, particularly in Fintech and Business Analytics. I am fascinated by how technological innovations can transform financial services and drive business decisions through data-driven insights.

As I continue my studies, I am eager to explore internship opportunities that will allow me to apply my skills in real-world settings, contribute to impactful projects, and learn from industry professionals.

I am particularly interested in roles that involve data & business analysis, financial technology development, digital financial services, and digital banking.
